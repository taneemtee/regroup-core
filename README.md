# regroup-core
Core platform for The Regroup Project. This is a non-profit initiative.

# Motivation
We were so optimistic about the Internet. We thought more information was better. Now we know that was wrong. We as humanity need to fix this. We need to regroup.

# Objectives
1. Improve the resiliency of civil society to polarization, misinformation, and conspiracies by massively scaling up volunteerism. We want millions of people to spend time in real world interactions with others on constructive, noble goals to reduce their vulnerability to predatory online sources.

2. Direct the hundreds of millions of generated volunteer hours towards new, innovative, and unconventional projects to drive lasting constructive impact in areas such as climate change, human rights, technology, and more.    

# Plan
Build a platform to scale up volunteering:

1. Build the source: create a funnel to onboard and ramp up new volunteers that is optimized by segment, to welcome people from all groups. The funnel probably consists of some kind of collection of interest-focused groups, backed by some kind of organizer tech platform. 

2. Build the sink: partner with existing relevant initiatives (such as existing volunteer organizations, as well as other groups that may have never thought about working with volunteers previously) and map them to our pool of volunteers
