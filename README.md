# regroup-core
Core platform for The Regroup Project. This is a non-profit initiative.

# Motivation
We were so optimistic about the Internet. We thought more information was better. Now we know that was wrong. We as humanity need to fix this. We need to regroup.

# Plan
1. Improve the resiliency of civil society to polarization, misinformation, and conspiracies by massively scaling up volunteerism. We want millions of people to spend time in real world interactions with others on constructive, noble goals to reduce their vulnerability to predatory online sources.

2. Direct the hundreds of millions of generated volunteer hours towards new, innovative, and unconventional projects to drive lasting constructive impact in areas such as climate change, human rights, technology, and more.
